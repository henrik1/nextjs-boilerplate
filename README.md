# NextJS Boilerplate with Sanity, React, Typescript, StyledComponents and more..
Pretty minimal boilerplate for NextJS + Sanity using styled-components, react, typescript and framer-motion.
Also features storybook and chromatic.

## The stack

### CMS

#### Sanity.io
From their own words;
[Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) is the platform for structured content. 
With Sanity.io you can manage your text, images, and other media with APIs. 
You can also use the open-source single page application Sanity Studio to quickly 
set up an editing environment that you can customize. With Sanity.io you have 
access to a bunch of APIs, libraries, and tooling that helps you leverage the 
benefits of having all your content available as a single source of truth. 
This article will quickly walk you through some central concepts, giving you a head 
start.

TL;DR; A headless cms.


#### Sanity studio
From their own words;
[Sanity Studio](https://www.sanity.io/studio) is an open-source CMS built with React.js. 
It offers rapid configuration and free form customization. Use our toolkits and plugins 
to create the workflow that optimizes for how you want to work with content.

TL;DR; A cms for the headless cms above


### Web

#### React
If you don't know this repo probably does not concern you.

#### NextJS
From their own words;
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) gives you the best developer experience with all the features
you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling,
route pre-fetching, and more. No config needed.

TL;DR; The thing that produces what readers can see, in a smart way.

#### Framer-motion
A production-ready motion library for React. Utilize the power behind Framer, the best 
prototyping tool for teams. Proudly open source.
A simple declarative syntax means you write less code. Less code means your codebase is 
easier to read and maintain.

#### Styled-Components
From their own words;
[Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/) utilises tagged template literals 
(a recent addition to JavaScript) and the power of CSS, and allows you to write actual 
CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and 
styles – using components as a low-level styling construct could not be easier! Utilising 
tagged template literals (a recent addition to JavaScript) and the power of CSS, 
styled-components allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also 
removes the mapping between components and styles – using components as a low-level styling 
construct could not be easier!

TL;DR; A modern approach to writing css without writing css.

#### Vercel
From their own words; 
[Vercel](https://vercel.com/), built by the same team that made Next.js, provides 
production-grade hosting for Next.js websites with zero configuration.

#### Storybook
From their own words;
Storybook is an open source tool for developing UI components in isolation for React, 
Vue, Angular, and more. It makes building stunning UIs organized and efficient.

TL;DR; Build and test the parts that make up the site in isolation.

#### Chromatic
From their own words;
[Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/) automates gathering UI feedback, visual testing, 
and documentation, so developers can iterate faster with less manual work.

TL;DR; Hosting and visual inspection of the output from above
